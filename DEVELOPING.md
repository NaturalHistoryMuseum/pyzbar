## Development

```
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip==20.3.4
pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m pytest --verbose --cov=pyzbar --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html pyzbar
python -m pyzbar.scripts.read_zbar pyzbar/tests/code128.png
```

### Test matrix of supported Python versions

Run tox

```
rm -rf .tox && tox
```

### Windows

The `pyzbar` directory contains both 32-bit (`libiconv-2.dll` and `libzbar-32.dll`)
and 64-bit (`ibiconv.dll` and `libzbar-64.dll`) DLLs.
The `load_zbar` function in `wrapper.py` looks for the appropriate DLLs.
The appropriate DLLs are packaged up into the wheel build and are installed
alongside the package source. This strategy allows the same method to be used
when `pyzbar` is run from source, as an installed package and when included in a
frozen binary.

## Releasing

1. Build

    Create wheel builds in the `dist` directory. The `win32` and `win_amd64`
    wheels will contain the appropriate `zbar.dll` and its dependencies.

    ```
   ./build.sh
    ```

2. Release to TestPyPI (see https://packaging.python.org/guides/using-testpypi/)

    ```
    twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
    ```

3. Test the release to TestPyPI

    * Check https://test.pypi.org/project/pyzbar/

    * If you are on Windows

    ```
    c:\python27\python.exe -m venv test1
    test1\scripts\activate
    ```

    * Install dependencies that are not on testpypi.python.org.
    If you are on Python 2.x, these are mandatory

    ```
    pip install enum34 pathlib
    ```

    * Pillow for tests and command-line programs. We can't use the
    `pip install pyzbar[scripts]` form here because `Pillow` will not be
    on testpypi.python.org

    ```
    pip install Pillow
    ```

    * Install the package itself

    ```
    pip install --index https://testpypi.python.org/simple pyzbar
    ```

    * Test

    ```
    read_zbar --help
    read_zbar <path-to-image-with-barcode.png>
    ```

4. If all is well, release to PyPI

    ```
    twine upload dist/*
    ```

    * Check https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyzbar/

    * Install!

    ```
    pip install pyzbar[scripts]
    ```
